# meso
15-112 term project

Meso is a civilization simulation game. The player can choose to create their 
own map with natural elements and manmade structures, or they can opt to use a 
randomly generated map. A starting population of humans is generated and starts 
to move around as time progresses, and the player can gradually upgrade the map. 
The town population increases with time and collisions, but civilization is also 
set back with periodic disasters. 

To run Meso, open up the main file called meso and run it in VSCode. It’s super simple!

This game doesn’t use any libraries or external modules outside of the usual 
basic_graphics and cmu_112_graphics.

Keyboard shortcuts:
p -> pause or unpause while the game is running
ENTER -> exit from the instructions popup
